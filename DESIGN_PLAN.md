Describe algorithm design, complexity analysis, correctness sketch, assumption, and test plan.

I will use insertion sort to sort the input. I will first create a dictionary with key (1-50) to represent the shelfs. I will then place the books into the corresponding shelf. Then I will sort the individual shelf using order #.
The time complexity of my algorithm is O(n^2) because I will need to go through each book in the input to place them into the correct shelf, and another O(n^2) time to sort the individual shelf by order #.
The space complexity of my algorithm is also O(n).
